  Directory operator tool providing file system operations similar to Linux commands.
  Supports listing files recursively (like 'ls -R') and copying files/directories (like 'cp -r').

  Operations:
  - list/ls: List files and directories with optional recursive traversal
  - copy/cp: Copy files and directories recursively

  Features:
  - Recursive directory traversal
  - File pattern filtering
  - Detailed file information (size, timestamps)
  - Error handling and validation
