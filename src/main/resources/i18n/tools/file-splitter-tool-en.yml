  Split text files (markdown, code, HTML, etc.) into smaller pieces. This tool helps break down
  large text files into manageable chunks while preserving content completeness.

  Important: Files are read from rootPlanId/shared/ directory, same as GlobalFileOperator and
  MarkdownConverterTool. For example, to split rootPlanId/shared/projects.md, use file_path "projects.md".

  Supported operations:
  - split: Split a file into 10 smaller pieces (as evenly as possible by lines)
    Parameters: file_path (required, relative to rootPlanId/shared/), header (optional - text to add at the beginning of each split file)
    Output files are saved in the same directory as the source file, named with index prefix: 0-filename.ext, 1-filename.ext, etc.
  - count: Count total lines and character size of a file
    Parameters: file_path (required, relative to rootPlanId/shared/)
