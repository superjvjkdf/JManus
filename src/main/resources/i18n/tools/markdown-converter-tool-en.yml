  Converts various file types to Markdown format with intelligent processing.
  **Core Strategy**: For Word documents (.doc, .docx), Excel files (.xlsx, .xls), and PDF files,
  strictly follows a Markdown-first approach - first converts to Markdown format,
  then processes the content for optimal readability and structure.
  Supports image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif) using OCR processing to extract text content.
  Supports text files (.txt, .md, .json, .xml, .yaml, .yml, .log, .java, .py, .js, .html, .css)
  with type-specific formatting.
  The converted file will be saved with .md extension in the root plan shared directory (rootPlanId/shared/).
  Additional requirements can be specified for custom conversion needs.
  **Best Practice**: Always convert complex documents to Markdown first for better content analysis and processing.
